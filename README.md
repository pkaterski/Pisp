# The Pisp Programming Language
![alt text](https://github.com/scala-fmi-classroom/final-project-pkaterski/blob/master/img/IMG_20210709_103705.jpg| width=100)
It's a lisp with a python-like syntax!

A FP language of the future but also from the past ;)

A very simple concept - everything is a statement and every statement is either a value or a definiton!

some examples:
```python
# comments

# bools
true
false

# integers
-1
0
1
2
3

# doubles
-1.1
0.5
1.0

# strings
"hohoho"

# lists
[1 2 3 4 5]
["a" 1 5.5]

# variables / defined or not / -- everything thats not a keyword
a
hoho

# keywords if/else, cond/case, def, lambda

# if statement
# if VALUE: VALUE else VALUE
if true:
  1
else:
  2

if true: 1 else: 2

# cond statements
cond:
  case 1 == 2: "one"
  case 2 == 2: "two"
  case 3 == 3: "three"
  else: "opa"

# definitions
def x:
  1

def x:
  def var:
    1
  var

def y: 2


def z: add(z 1)

def f x:
  add(x x)

def g x y z:
  add(mul(x y) z)

# lambdas / can be passed around as annonimous functions
lambda x:
  sum(x 1)

# function calls
f(x)
g(x y z)

# special notation
x@f == f(x)


# lambda calls
(lambda x: add(x 1))(1) == 2
(lambda x y: add(x y))(1 2) == 3


# Checkout the prelude for some examples
# You can also check the examples folder / WIP /


# IO
print(1 x) == x # side effect: 1 is printed
debug(x) == x # side effect: x is printed
input == ? # a variable with a side effect: user input, each time when called it is evaluated
# checkout ./examples/IO.pisp for how to use this

```
